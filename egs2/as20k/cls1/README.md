# AudioSet-20K Audio Classification Recipe

This recipe implements the audio classification task with a BEATs encoder and linear layer decoder model on the [AudioSet-20K](https://research.google.com/audioset/)(AS-20K) dataset, very close to what is described in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09058).
More specifically, we provide the fine-tuning config and results for the last row in Table 1 (BEATS-iter3+) from the paper.
We reuse part of the code from the [BEATs repository](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/beats) for this implementation.

# Training Details and Requirements
AS-20K is a balanced multi-label classification dataset with 20k training samples.
Fine-tuning needs 1 GPU with ~40 GB memory and runs for ~15 hours on L40.

# Steps to run
1. Download AudioSet YouTube ids and get corresponding audio. Set the path to its root directory in db.sh (`AUDIOSET`). Please look at `local/data.sh` to understand the procedure for pre-processing data.
2. Download the BEATs checkpoint: [BEATs_iter3+ (AS20K)](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/beats) and change the `beats_ckpt_path` path in `conf/beats_cls.yaml`
3. Launch with `run.sh`.

# Trained checkpoints
